## Overview
This is a task from Frontend Mentor to build a Faq Accordance Car Main to aid my proficiency in learning CSS Grid.

### What I learned

I learnt how to use the position attribute when positioning element in styling an object or image.
I also learnt how to use the after pseudo selector and input content inside it.

```html
   <summary>
   </summary>
```
```css
  summary::after {
      content: url(an image is here);
      transform: scale(1.2);
      position: absolute;
      right: 2rem;
      transition: all .5s;
    }
```

### Continued development    

I would love to focus more on other css pseudo selectors like the before, nth child, last-child etc to become a more better developer.
